<p>This report by People Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English and annotate it with my thoughts and references.</p>

<hr />

<p>The effectiveness of macroeconomic policy depends on the availability of quality information. However, as revolutionary technologies ushered in the Information Age, the traditional model of macroeconomic policy-making is impacted in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>market failure + government failure, causing global economic unrest; (<em>when the market has access to more quality information than the government does, the latter will fail in regulating the economy</em>)</li>
  <li>the information explosion is challenging governmentâ€™s capacity to regulate and assert control over the economy.</li>
</ol>

<p>On one hand, the abundance of information should help the government gauge the condition and needs of the society, thus improving its efficiency in policy implementation; one the other hand, without the capacity to discover and classify information by adapting its value functions and cost functions, the government will be buried in the increase of information entropy which it could not handle, chaos ensue and economies perish. (<em>The 1929 crisis is an example, where value function changed from the end of gold standard, and the Hoover administration incorrectly believed free market mechanism could resolve it on its own. Sever market failure and government failure ensued. Another example is the Global Financial Crisis, where the rise of BRIC shifted USâ€™s original value function and production function, along with the mutation of value function caused by asset bubbles, and markets broke down.</em>)</p>

<p>Simply put, in the Information Age, traditional economic theories and models are ineffective. The governments that fail to adapt quickly will see their countries and economies driven into crises.</p>

<p>2020 is a watershed year, where 2 frameworks are violently challenged by technological revolution:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the classical liberal monetary theory and the associated framework for monetary policy implementation;</li>
  <li>government-centered framework for monetary policy implementation.
(<em>We have 2 options: 1/ close borders, shut down the flow of information, cling to the traditional model, revert to adversarial competition, and enter the dark age again; 2/ a world we look forward to living in, where humans follow the technological revolution, research and construct new economic and financial patterns, and discover new value functions.</em>)</li>
</ol>

<p>The entire world is now going through violent volatility as COVID-19 wreaked havoc, US presidential election approaches, the OPEC-Russia oil talk broke down, and Chinaâ€™s economy faces higher risk of downturn.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture, central banks around the world coordinate with the US to implement massive scale monetary policies, while the promise and grand narrative of digital currency gains popularity.</p>

<p>From a data standpoint, Chinaâ€™s M2/GDP is apparently higher than other countries, which leads many to incorrectly believe that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>there is a currency over-issuance in China;</li>
  <li>Chinaâ€™s financial system is particularly inefficient;</li>
  <li>China needs to tighten its monetary supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>(<em>There are 2 ways to calculate GDP: 1/ output-based, where GDP=total value of goods sold minus the value of intermediate goods purchased to produce the goods sold; 2/ income-based, where GDP=total net income of its citizens.</em>)</p>

<p>Indeed, M2/GDP is an important indicator for a countryâ€™s macroeconomic policy-making. To understand it better, we need to answer 3 questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is Chinaâ€™s GDP?</li>
  <li>How to solve for accurate GDP statistics in real time?</li>
  <li>In the face of skyrocketing uncertainty, where should Chinaâ€™s monetary policies go?</li>
</ol>

<p>(<em>China is unique in its challenges and economic patterns, which calls for unique problem-solving approaches.</em>)</p>

<p>These are the â€œGoldbach-conjectureâ€ questions in monetary finance, and we need to answer these questions now.</p>

<p>The key lies in the solution. Following the revolutionary innovation in information technology and fintech, we have discovered the thought process that would lead us to the solution:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Build mcir</li>
</ol>
