<p>This report by the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English.</p>

<h3 id="question-3-what-are-the-next-steps-for-the-central-bank-and-monetary-policy-of-china">Question 3: what are the next steps for the central bank and monetary policy of China?</h3>

<p>Step 1 should be prioritizing full employment via developing the private economy and incentivizing small and medium business creation by creating the best business environment and currency system in the world. Step 2 should be progressively building the marketization of accurate and dynamic economic data at the micro-scale to achieve the value creation function of our currency as well as surpass US in GDP per capita. Step 3 should be creating the currency system whose foundation is the economic value of the individuals, progressively achieving the maximization of individualsâ€™ values as the goal of our scientific currency governance system.</p>

<p>In 2020, the economy and financial markets in China is faced with unprecedented challenge and uncertainty. Since the beginning of the year, the world has seen the widespread of COVID-19, the huge volatility in US and European stock markets, and the US stock market hitting its circuit breakers multiple times within a month. In response, US has implemented extremely expansionary monetary policies by reducing interest rate to zero and injecting 5 trillion dollars into the economy.</p>

<p>We shall consider the special risks China is faced with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The expansionary US monetary policy likely induces risk at the global scale. Being the world reserve currency and driven by zero interest rate, the eventual oversupply of US dollar will spread across the world and buy up assets with good fundamentals at low prices, causing an aggregation of resources into the US, which forms a new era of US dollar supremacy. In contrast, China will lose competitiveness at best and fall into a long-term suppression by the US in the global monetary system at worst. If at the same juncture US rolls out the digital US dollar by coordinating with Facebookâ€™s Libra platform, the currency will dominate all cross-border payments. The resulting financial hegemony will be fatal to China.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chinaâ€™s progress in globalization will be severely impeded by this financial attack from the US. Given USâ€™s control over the global financial system, its financial attack would prove to be fatal to any other country. China should take aggressive precautions in trade settlement, currency system, and the new digital currency paradigm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three major internal risks in China. The Munich Security Conference this year has demonstrated the global anti-China rhetoric. With our increasingly open financial system, risk exposure to the global markets and politics grows. Besides, we are faced with unprecedented bottlenecks in developing our economic system and structure.</p>
  </li>

<p>Considering the possibility of government failure, market failure, the external impacts, and the major internal risks, we could consider implementing the 3 following steps:</p>

<h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>
<p>Prioritize full employment as the ultimate goal of our monetary policy. Full employment is an achievement toward the maximization of individualsâ€™ economic values. We have to focus on both the quantity and quality aspects of employment. As long as we can improve the economic value of our entire 1.4 billion population, we will no longer fear any external impact.</p>

<p>The traditional model of monetary policy usually focuses on economic growth targets and inflation targets. These targets are increasingly misleading due to the massive changes in our economyâ€™s value function, production function and growth function. It will be an obvious mistake to try to control growth. Compounded by the uniqueness in China GDP statistics and M2 structure, we are prone to fall into statistics traps systemically and structurally, causing government failure.</p>

<p>There is massive room for improvement in terms of Chinaâ€™s employment. By fully embracing the technological revolution, we stand to benefit from an institutional dividend surpassing the one we have enjoyed over the past 30 years of economic reform.</p>

<h4 id="step-2">Step 2</h4>
<p>Progressively build the marketization of accurate and dynamic economic data at the micro-scale to achieve the value creation function of our currency as well as surpass US in GDP per capita.</p>

<p>Our central banks now operate in the credit-based model, while the central bank of the future will operate in the value-based model. Since the advent of central banks, they are solely responsible for the issuance of currency while balancing the inflationary and deflationary forces. A good central bank would achieve the massive issuance of currency without creating uncontrollable inflations. Witnessing the rising US dollar index during the aggressive issuance of more US dollar proves that the US central bank is a massively successful central bank - it successfully sucks liquidity and value from global markets and economies. We must be cognizant of the exploitative nature of the American monetary system and debunk it. The rise of China hinges on the advancement of our currency system and the promotion of the value of our currency.</p>
