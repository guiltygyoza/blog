<p>This report by the People’s Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English.</p>

<h3 id="question-3-what-are-the-next-steps-for-the-central-bank-and-monetary-policy-of-china">Question 3: what are the next steps for the central bank and monetary policy of China?</h3>

<p>Step 1 should be prioritizing full employment via developing the private economy and incentivizing small and medium business creation by creating the best business environment and currency system in the world. Step 2 should be progressively building the marketization of accurate and dynamic economic data at the micro-scale to achieve the value creation function of our currency as well as surpass US in GDP per capita. Step 3 should be creating the currency system whose foundation is the economic value of the individuals, progressively achieving the maximization of individuals’ values as the goal of our scientific currency governance system.</p>

<p>In 2020, the economy and financial markets in China is faced with unprecedented challenge and uncertainty. Since the beginning of the year, the world has seen the widespread of COVID-19, the huge volatility in US and European stock markets, and the US stock market hitting its circuit breakers multiple times within a month. In response, US has implemented extremely expansionary monetary policies by reducing interest rate to zero and injecting 5 trillion dollars into the economy.</p>

<p>We shall consider the special risks China is faced with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The expansionary US monetary policy likely induces risk at the global scale. Being the world reserve currency and driven by zero interest rate, the eventual oversupply of US dollar will spread across the world and buy up assets with good fundamentals at low prices, causing an aggregation of resources into the US, which forms a new era of US dollar supremacy. In contrast, China will lose competitiveness at best and fall into a long-term suppression by the US in the global monetary system at worst. If at the same juncture US rolls out the digital US dollar by coordinating with Facebook’s Libra platform, the currency will dominate all cross-border payments. The resulting financial hegemony will be fatal to China.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>China’s progress in globalization will be severely impeded by this financial attack from the US. Given US’s control over the global financial system, its financial attack would prove to be fatal to any other country. China should take aggressive precautions in trade settlement, currency system, and the new digital currency paradigm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three major internal risks in China. The Munich Security Conference this year has demonstrated the global anti-China rhetoric. With our increasingly open financial system, risk exposure to the global markets and politics grows. Besides, we are faced with unprecedented bottlenecks in developing our economic system and structure.</p>

<p>Considering the possibility of government failure, market failure, the external impacts, and the major internal risks, we could consider implementing the 3 following steps:</p>

<h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>
<p>Prioritize full employment as the ultimate goal of our monetary policy. Full employment is an achievement toward the maximization of individuals’ economic values. We have to focus on both the quantity and quality aspects of employment. As long as we can improve the economic value of our entire 1.4 billion population, we will no longer fear any external impact.</p>

<p>(<em>中国的货币政策包括四大目标：经济发展、充分就业、物价稳定、国际收支平衡。这四个目标相互依存又相互制约。</em>)</p>

<p>The traditional model of monetary policy usually focuses on economic growth targets and inflation targets. These targets are increasingly misleading due to the massive changes in our economy’s value function, production function and growth function. It will be an obvious mistake to try to control growth. Compounded by the uniqueness in China GDP statistics and M2 structure, we are prone to fall into statistics traps systemically and structurally, causing government failure.</p>

<p>(<em>科技革命所引起的信息化革命对于人类的一个重大贡献就是人的价值可以准确地被计量与管理！这个价值函数的改变将对经济学理论、金融理论、货币理论产生深远的影响，甚至对人类社会的历史与历史研究产生重要的影响！
[xxx] 经济增长函数的目标函数是人的价值而不是商品的价值。这个转换的重要意义在于经济分析能够具有连续性，也就是说，生产商品是为了提高人的价值，同时，价值也是人创造的。2020年发生的新冠病毒对于人类的一个重要的意义在于实现这个增长目标的转型、价值函数的转型，这个转型具有划时代的意义。在新的价值函数中，货币与人的价值一体化了，不再有通胀和通缩，而且一旦人的价值与货币的价值尺度功能合一，充分就业就会使国际竞争力增强，实现国际收支平衡。</em>)</p>

<p>There is massive room for improvement in terms of China’s employment. By fully embracing the technological revolution, we stand to benefit from an institutional dividend surpassing the one we have enjoyed over the past 30 years of economic reform.</p>

<p>(<em>[xxxii] 根据本人研究，中国的经济发展还有6大红利：制度红利丶劳动力红利、科学技术红利、资源红利、国际化红利和生态化红利。</em>)</p>

<h4 id="step-2">Step 2</h4>
<p>Progressively build the marketization of accurate and dynamic economic data at the micro-scale to achieve the value creation function of our currency as well as surpass US in GDP per capita.</p>

<p>Our central banks now operate in the credit-based model, while the central bank of the future will operate in the value-based model. Since the advent of central banks, they are solely responsible for the issuance of currency while balancing the inflationary and deflationary forces. A good central bank would achieve the massive issuance of currency without creating uncontrollable inflations. Witnessing the rising US dollar index during the aggressive issuance of more US dollar proves that the US central bank is a massively successful central bank - it successfully sucks liquidity and value from global markets and economies. We must be cognizant of the exploitative nature of the American monetary system and debunk it.</p>

<p>(<em>2020年初的新冠病毒引起的美国股市暴跌，美联储以此为藉口祭出了超级宽松的货币政策是对全世界财富的重新洗牌，需要引起世界各国的高度重视，美国可以利用这一个机会，发挥美元的世界货币功能，在零利率的引导下并购全球资产，这个对于美国以外的其他国家将是灾难性的。这一点可以解释为什么落后的国家如南美、非洲、中东等国家总是越来越穷呢（现在是前苏联地区也进入了这个圈套），就是美国利用市场机制和货币机制可以无偿的占有这些国家的价值。实际上全世界都是在为美国生产，但是美国现有总统并不满足，认为美国还剥削的不够，还是千方百计地打压这些国家（就像奴隶主对待奴隶一样的残忍。）</em>)</p>
