<h3 id="question-3-what-are-the-next-steps-for-the-central-bank-and-monetary-policy-of-china">Question 3: what are the next steps for the central bank and monetary policy of China?</h3>

<p>Step 1 should be prioritizing full employment via developing the private economy and incentivizing small and medium business creation by creating the best business environment and currency system in the world. Step 2 should be progressively building the marketization of accurate and dynamic economic data at the micro-scale to achieve the value creation function of our currency as well as surpassing US in GDP per capita. Step 3 should be creating the currency system whose foundation is the economic value of the individuals, progressively achieving the maximization of individuals’ values as the goal of our scientific currency governance system.</p>

<h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>
<p>In 2020, the economy and financial markets in China is faced with unprecedented challenge and uncertainty.</p>
