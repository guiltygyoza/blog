<h3 id="question-2-how-to-solve-for-accurate-timely-and-sufficient-gdp-statistics">Question 2: How to solve for accurate, timely, and sufficient GDP statistics?</h3>

<p><strong>My proposal is: explore marketized big data, analyze the process of GDP statistics formation at the micro scale, and construct a new univariate econometric model based on individual value function.</strong></p>

<p>The modern time calls for a new macroeconomic data industry, where modern information technology is fully leveraged to build a macroeconomic big data system that is real-time, dynamic, and accurate, and to transform this process into a process of value creation. The fourth plenary meeting of the nineteenth Central Committee of the CPC made it very clear that data is a mean of production and is involved in economic resource allocation in China. Large-scale macroeconomic models will be built on this foundation, solve for accurate and timely economic big data and achieve objectivity and timeliness in our monetary policy-making.</p>

<h4 id="1-multivariate-big-data-model-for-gdp">1. Multivariate big data model for GDP</h4>
<p>We shall first construct the multivariate big data for GDP by considering the four sectors: families (f), businesses (b), governments (g) and exports (e). The GDP equals to the sum of value functions of all sectors:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/eq1.svg" alt="equation" /></p>

<p>Given that, we can solve for both output-based and income-based GDP. From the income perspective, we shall consider:</p>
<ol>
  <li>labor income</li>
  <li>business revenue</li>
  <li>tax revenue</li>
  <li>export revenue</li>
</ol>

<p>From the output perspective, we shall consider:</p>
<ol>
  <li>consumption</li>
  <li>investment</li>
  <li>government spending</li>
  <li>oversea spending</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="2-univariate-big-data-for-gdp">2. Univariate big data for GDP</h4>
<p>Second, we consider the univariate big data for GDP â€” the big data of every single citizenâ€™s economic record. We shall create the markets their transaction structures for these data, as well as the legal entities that provide custody for these data so that the data property right of every single citizen is authenticated and protected. Every citizen will own his/her data as his/her asset, and consequently, individual balance sheets and survival statistics will be created. The univariate model is simple but extremely powerful because by viewing the individuals as the only variable, where every citizenâ€™s economic value, labor income, capital gains, expenses and investments are all available in the data markets, solving for GDP becomes straightforward:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/eq2.svg" alt="equation" /></p>

<p>Where <em>P</em> is our countryâ€™s population. The 2 GDP results shall validate each other. This simplification of data model will be connected to our digital currency and ultimately to our monetary policy-making.</p>

<p>We shall recognize that solving for multivariate functions is extremely difficult â€” the gathering of statistics is a complex process, the calculation is difficult, and more importantly there are enormous uncertainties and intractability in decomposing values across sectors and entities. Nevertheless, the analysis of the multivariate functions help us understand the mechanism of value propagation as well as how to validate the results.</p>

<p>Solving univariate value functions for GDP will massively simplify the process of economic analysis, making the verification of taxation feasible.</p>

<p>From the perspective of research methodology, we shall acknowledge that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sum of all individualâ€™s economic value is the total economic value of our society;</li>
  <li>The time integral of all individualâ€™s economic value growth rate over a time period yields us our GDP over the same time period.</li>
  <li>This univariate economic model will concretize our societyâ€™s goals and directions in value production. Because ultimately, the goal of all humanâ€™s economic activities is to serve the humans and improve the economic values of humans.</li>
  <li>To this day we have been mistakenly using the values of commodities and currencies as the goal of our economic growth, which has led to money fetishism and commodity fetishism, misleading our society and causing enormous wealth gap and moral hazards.</li>
  <li>Solving GDP via univariate model will turn every individualâ€™s economic data into real digital assets. Together with digital currency based on blockchain technology, this digital currency will no longer serve only as a unit of account for value but also as a mean to create value. Once we reach this goal, our monetary system and monetary policy will enter a new era.</li>
</ul>

<p>(<em>In traditional economics, the value or price of commodity is used as the primary variable in value functions, which goes against the original meaning of value. Value is the utilty to human, and is also created by human. Value function should a continuous function, not the disconnected ones between supply and demand, between the market and the society, and between human and nature. The most profound impact of technology and information reovlution is to revolutionize the meaning of value, particularly when blockchain technology and big data technology are combined to discover, manage and create values, and at the same time unifying the unit-of-account and value-creation roles of currency, thereby eliminating the possibility of inflation and deflation once and for all. This could be the most important role and meaning of digital currency.</em>)</p>

<h4 id="3-construct-big-data-models-for-consumption-and-investments-and-the-associated-systems-of-market-operators-and-participants">3. Construct big data models for <em>consumption and investments</em>, and the associated systems of market operators and participants</h4>

<p>The value of any market is information and value discovery. Here, we will create:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a management system of consumption and supply chain data, and</li>
  <li>a management system of investment values
Then we shall privatize these 2 systems into markets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our first step is to construct the mathematical relationship between GDP and individual economic value, consumption and investment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each individualâ€™s economic value <em>v</em> is comprised of <em>v_l</em>, the net flow of value, and <em>v_w</em>, the stock of value. GDP shall equal to the time integral of all individualâ€™s economic value growth over a period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/eq3.svg" alt="equation" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>v_c</em> denotes value spent on consumption, while <em>v_i</em> denotes value spent on investments. GDP shall also equal to the time integral of all individualâ€™s <em>v_c</em> and <em>v_i</em> over the same period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/eq4.svg" alt="equation" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>v_rl</em> denotes labor income, while <em>v_rk</em> denotes capital gains. Again, GDP shall also equal to the time integral of all individualâ€™s <em>v_rl</em> and <em>v_rk</em> over the same period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/eq5.svg" alt="equation" /></p>

<p>With further research we conclude that these equations coincide with the production function and the economic growth function in traditional economics, while also coincide with Marxâ€™s labor theory of value. If we succeed at solving every individualâ€™s economic value via big data and blockchain technology, we will also solve the historic puzzle of Marxist theory.</p>

<p>(<em>There are 2 problems with Marxâ€™s labor theory of value. First, Marx also started from the value of commodity to solve for value and declared that labor is a function of commodity. Second, due to the technological limitation at the time, Marx could not differentiate between simple and complex labor, thus adopted average intensity of labor to formulate the price of commodity. This ignorance of differences in human values led Marxism into equalitarianism, on which many socialist countries struggled later on.</em>)</p>

<p>If we look at the relationship between the proposed model and the production function and Solow Model of economic growth in traditional economics, we will find that they coincide with each other except that the proposed model is univariate, which makes economics more objective. Furthermore, treating labor as the flow of human value and capital as the stock of human value, we achieve a massive simplification and improvement over existing value functions. Facilitated by blockchain and big data technology, the new theory on production and economic growth becomes significantly more scientific.</p>

<p>(<em>The original production function separates labor and capital, thus making their relationship implicit. In traditional economics, sometimes the capital variable is represented by the labor variable via logarithm, which makes the anaylsis more difficult and intractable. Sticking to the univariate model based on individualsâ€™ economic values will bypass this problem. Further research finds that the revolutionary meaning of this model lies in its introduction of blockchain and big data technology into the Walrasian model in order to solve for Walrasian equilibrium and the Philips curve.</em>)</p>

<p>Our second step is to discover the mechanisms of consumption function and investment function at the micro scale.</p>

<p>(<em>In my research I created this model where, through the marketization and custody of individualsâ€™ consumption and investment data, data becomes a mean of production, thereby triggers the price discovery mechanism and incentive mechanism in the markets, which facilitates the collection of macroeconomic statistics. In China, this model should involve centrally-owned or state-owned enterprises, or outsource its operation to large Chinese tech companies while having small and medium businesses participate as market makers.</em>)</p>

<p>An important milestone in the transition from commodity economy to digital economy is the transition from traditional accounting model to blockchain model for managing values. We are witnessing the transition from stock-based economics to token economics. By leveraging the distributed ledgers provided by blockchain technology to record and manage every individualâ€™s economic value, we will achieve the democratization of our economic system. Stock is a certificate for dividend allocation based on numbers of shares. However, in a truly digital economy, the data owned by every individual has value and is involved in the allocation process, thus making the blockchain-based token the certificate for dividend allocation based on every individualâ€™s economic value. This transition transforms the way resources are allocated in human societies, giving every single person the right to participate in the process of resource allocation. Every individualâ€™s economic data essentially reflects the individualâ€™s capacity to create economic value. The advent of token econmoics will mark a giant leap for mankind â€” fully discovering and managing the economic values of human and improving the process of value creation. Under this system, every individual has a right to freedom based on the individualâ€™s true economic value, thus eliminating exploitation and inequality in our society.</p>

<p>(<em>From the historical perspective, the first civilization is the primitive society, where resource allocation is determined by physical strengths; the second civilization is the class society, where resource allocation is determined by ownership of means of production; the third civilization is the one we are creating now, the scientific society where resource allocation is determined by the marketzied and technological process, and the flow of value is denominated in the blockchain-based token tied to the individualsâ€™ economic values.</em>)</p>

<p>We forsee companies in the big data industry providing custody solutions for every individualâ€™s consumption and investment data, achieving unambiguous demarcation and protection of property rights through proper regulation. These property rights are involved in the process of value allocation. Via Walrasian equilibrium, accurate consumption and investment data can be determined, which leads to accurate calculation of GDP. Considering Randall Wright still based his research on the utility theory of value and failed to consider the revolutionary impact of modern information technology on value calculation and modeling. Interestingly, Wright believed that the creation of currency creates value by resolving information asymmetry and incentivizing production expand. We also believe that the creation of currency creates value because the currency and its associated monetary policies are tied to every individualâ€™s economic values. From this perspective, the US is priviledged with its ability to create value at a global scale and possess the value of other countries. We think it is possible that the global economy is facing the monopolization by the US once again.</p>

<p>(<em>This is why we should pay special attention to the significant change in US monetary policy in 2020. Jerome Powell of the US Federal Reserve announced on March 16 2020 that, in response to global COVID-19 pandemic and the stock market crash, 5 trillion dollar worth of relief package and zero interest rate are offered. In an open global economy and from the perspective of this essay, the massive issuance of US dollar will extract the labor values of people worldwide while creating massive value for the US. Given that US dollar is the global reserve currency, it will effectively confiscate value from people worldwide for free.</em>)</p>

<p>Tracking every individualâ€™s labor income and capital gains via the new value management system is logically consistent with the traditional production function and growth function.</p>

<p>Following the discussion on spending (consumption and invesment), we now move on to the discussion on income and the creation of the marketization paradigm.</p>

<p>Every individual will be able to manage his/her own value in the blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Every individual can trade on the right to use his/her own labor time in the future and earn income on the distributed ledgers. Capital gains are considered as the value of an individualâ€™s labor time in the past. Together they form the tradeable token, which enters into the business value chains and commodity value chains. Therefore, token economics is crucial to our future. With token economics, we will have access to the data required for accurate monetary policy implementation. More importantly, this token as the new form of currency is originated from the process of value creation at the individual level, which could also transform into a mechanism for currency issuance. This token-currency is completely driven by the objective discovery of value in the markets and thus directly represents the economic values of our citizens.</p>

<p>(<em>There are many ways to define a digital token. In this essay we are referring to the token that represent the individualâ€™s economic value. Token economics have drawn wide attention worldwide; Germany and UK proposed economic strategies based on token economics, while the US is considering the creation of the digital dollar via Facebookâ€™s offering of Libra. Combined with the extremely loosen monetary policy, the Libra-based digital dollar will

<p>Because the entire process of value propagation and discovery is marketized and dynamic, output-based GDP and income-based GDP will be congruous. With this as its foundation, the new monetary policy framework will be continuous and instantaneous. The central bank deepens its reach into the process of value discovery, creation and management, which will be a important feature of the digital economy era. This new role of central bank and currency is driven by the continuous innovation in information technology.</p>

<p>The application of this model is crucial to Chinaâ€™s future. It will quickyl and effectively increase the per capita economic value of the Chinese, which, if equals to that of the US, will result in Chinaâ€™s GDP standing at 3-4x of US GDP. The more profound impact of this model is that it signifies an epoch-making revolution.</p>
