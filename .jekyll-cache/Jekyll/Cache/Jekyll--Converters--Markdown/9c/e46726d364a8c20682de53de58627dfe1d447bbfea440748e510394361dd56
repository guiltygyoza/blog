<p>This report by the Peopleâ€™s Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English.</p>

<p>Zou Pingzuo, chief researcher at Peopleâ€™s Bank of China</p>

<h3 id="question-3-what-are-the-next-steps-for-the-central-bank-and-monetary-policy-of-china">Question 3: what are the next steps for the central bank and monetary policy of China?</h3>

<p>Step 1 should be prioritizing full employment via developing the private economy and incentivizing small and medium business creation by creating the best business environment and currency system in the world. Step 2 should be progressively building the marketization of accurate and dynamic economic data at the micro-scale to achieve the value creation function of our currency as well as surpassing US in GDP per capita. Step 3 should be creating the currency system whose foundation is the economic value of the individuals, progressively achieving the maximization of individualsâ€™ values as the goal of our scientific currency governance system.</p>

<h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>
<p>In 2020, the economy and financial markets in China is faced with unprecedented challenge and uncertainty. Since the beginning of the year, the world has seen the widespread of COVID-19, the huge volatility in US and European stock markets, and the US stock market hitting its circuit breakers multiple times within a month. In response, US has implemented extremely expansionary monetary policies by reducing interest rate to zero and injecting 5 trillion dollars into the economy.</p>

<p>We shall consider the special risks China is faced with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The expansionary US monetary policy likely induces risk at the global scale. Being the world reserve currency and driven by zero interest rate, the eventual oversupply of US dollar will spread across the world and buy up assets with good fundamentals at low prices, causing an aggregation of resources into the US, which forms a new era of US dollar supremacy. In contrast, China will lose competitiveness at best and fall into a long-term suppression by the US in the global monetary system at worst. If at the same juncture US rolls out the digital US dollar by coordinating with Facebookâ€™s Libra platform, the currency will dominate all cross-border payments. The resulting financial hegemony will be fatal to China.</li>
</ol>
