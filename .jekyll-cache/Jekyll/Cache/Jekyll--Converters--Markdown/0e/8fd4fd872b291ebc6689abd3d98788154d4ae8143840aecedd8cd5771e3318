<p>這是我們第二次發佈年報，旨在討論我們對科技、市場的看法，以及我們的任務。</p>

<p>八年半前，我們成立了 Social Capital，瞄準癌症、太空探索、氣候變遷等很少同行關注的難題。當同行為了社群網路、照片共享 app 等消費者導向應用而瘋狂，我們專注投資醫療照護、教育，和太空探索與 AI 等前沿科技。很多我們投資的公司，是本來沒有任何機構投資者願意注資的，只有我們願意提供長期、有耐性的資本支持他們。我們希望這些賭注能夠帶來回報。2018 年，我們的希望開始實現了，同時我們也決定：傳統的募資與資本管理模式不再適用於 Social Capital。傳統的模式可以帶給我們豐潤的回報，卻將妨礙我們實現我們的任務。因此，2018 年中，我們停止對外募資，成為一家科技控股公司。</p>

<p>儘管我們將持續微調策略來應對世界趨勢的變化。我們的任務始終不變：我們想要賦能創業家解決世界上最難的問題，同時在經濟方面與社會方面催生龐大的複利收益。</p>

<h3 id="what-the-hell-is-going-on">What the hell is going on?</h3>
<p>1870-1900 的鍍金時代 (Gilded Age) 期間，美國經濟快速成長，標準化的小學和中學數量大增。時值鐵路技術高速發展，帶動工廠、礦場與農場的擴建，而當時的華爾街一如今日扮演金融仲介，為所有項目籌措資金，並催生鐵路泡沫的膨脹與破裂。在這段期間，大量移民湧入美國，並逐漸形塑了階級結構 — 最頂層 1% 擁有全社會1/4以上的資產，而最底層 50% 擁有的資產總合不到全社會的 4%。</p>

<p><em>如果把 “鐵路” 置換為 “科技”，重讀以上文字，有沒有覺得很熟悉？</em></p>

<p>鍍金年代的三十年間發生了兩次市場危機 – 1873 和 1893 市場恐慌。經濟上，南北戰爭後的南方各州深陷泥淖，無法從廉價商品產業脫離出來。政治上，兩黨對立激化，總統無能，國會陷入僵局。</p>

<p><em>如果把 “1873 和 1893 市場恐慌” 置換為 “互聯網泡沫和金融危機”，把 “南北戰爭後的南方各州”置換為 “中西部”，重讀以上文字，有沒有覺得很熟悉？</em></p>

<p>社會上，鍍金時代期間人們開始推動女性投票權、保障勞工權益的工會、終止童工，正視企業壟斷的不良後果。同時，市值居冠的鐵路公司開始遭受批評與仇恨。農夫們與壟斷的鐵路公司對抗，要求價格管制。人們對這些鐵路公司的負面情緒不斷升高。南太平洋鐵路公司董事長 Collis P. Huntington 成為眾矢之的。後來教科書指出：「在當時社會的眼裏，Huntington 象徵了貪婪與十九世紀晚期的企業貪腐。他的對手和政治改革者視他為一切邪惡的源頭。記者和漫畫家以嘲諷他而成名…歷史學家將他描繪為全國最卑劣的惡棍。」</p>

<p><em>如果把 “Collis P. Huntington” 置換為 “貝佐斯或扎克伯格”，你懂我的意思。</em></p>

<p>簡言之，鍍金時代與今天似乎有太多相似之處。這裡的重點不是道德討論，而是去探討：鍍金時代後發生了什麼事？美國社會如何回應？於今日有何借鑑？我們的答案是，鍍金時代的奢侈與腐敗催生了進步時代 (Progressive Age)。對此維基百科有如下總結：</p>

<p>「進步時代在美國歷史上是指 1890-1920 年間，美國的社會行動主義和政治改良紛紛湧現的一個時代。進步時代的主軸在於解決工業化、都市化、移民與政治貪腐的問題。藉由揭露和削弱政治利益集團和其大佬的方式淨化美國政府，同時建立直接民主的參政方式。進步運動者也試圖通過反壟斷法監管托拉斯集團，促進公平競爭，並推動政府成立新的監管機制與組織，例如食品藥物管理署。」</p>

<h3 id="鍍金時代重演">鍍金時代重演</h3>
<p>過去三十年，我們創造了一種新的「鐵路技術」，並目睹鍍金時代的重演。少數幾家公司發展的技術使社會上各種成本大幅降低、各種價值提高，達到令人難以想像的消費者剩餘。然而，這些進步背後的成本是什麼？</p>

<p>這些公司的創辦人和員工的財富、地位和影響力激增，其餘社會則面臨薪資停滯、不安全感蔓延。許多人開始相信自己無法帶給下一代更多的發展機會。民粹主義興起。右派的政治傀儡祭出嚴格的邊境政策、主張經濟民族主義，而右派的政治傀儡則提出全民社會福利。整個社會都在期盼著改變。</p>

<p>不管你相信或喜歡與否，這些改變提案都能在政治傀儡的主張中清晰可見。任何科技產品的第一版儘管毫不張揚卻不吝於投射高遠的野心 (e.g. iPhone, Facebook, Google Search)，政治表演裡的手段也是如此。Trump、Warren 和 Sanders 之後，我們將看到更新穎、更迅速、更完善的進步思想在美國和世界各地茁壯。我們將面臨一個定義時代的十字路口。</p>

<p>在這背景之下，過去幾年神似鍍金時代的末期、進步時代的開端。</p>

<h3 id="監管緊縮">監管緊縮</h3>
<p>鍍金時代終結的第一砲將由針對科技巨頭 (微軟、蘋果、亞馬遜、谷歌、臉書) 的反托斯法案打響。各國政府已經意識到自己有責任介入將這些巨頭分解，強迫分拆，提升透明度，特別是針對以廣告收益為主的公司，要求更改廣告競價算法來限制程式化競價，並限制大範圍的數據搜集與用戶監控。有些人認為這違反資本主義的初衷，但我們認為這是讓資本主義在整個社會裡有效運作的實際作法。</p>

<p>當政府和監管者踏出第一步，必須嚴防大型科技公司滲透立法程序進一步合理化當前的壟斷態勢。監管者必須與無利益相關的各領域專家合作，學習大型科技公司的商業模式、這些商業模式對社會的正面和負面影響、如何圍堵負面影響、如何保護中小型企業和保障個人自由與隱私權。</p>

<p>倘若順利，未來十年之內科技巨頭將被分解。</p>

<p>這代表 iPhone、Azure、AWS、Amazon Retail、Google Search、Youtube、Gmail、Google Cloud Platform、Facebook、 WhatsApp 和 Instagram 將各自成為獨立的公司，禁止數據共享。同時，擁有第三方廣告網路的公司必須將其分拆出去。這一個階段象徵著互聯網經濟裡的供給方壟斷程度下降、需求方話語權提升。</p>

<p>增稅，是鍍金時代終結的第二步。</p>

<p>政府將要求科技巨頭納入用戶所在地的地區徵稅。儘管初期將因租稅協定、關稅戰爭等因素而進展緩慢，這樣的趨勢是確定的，因為今日各國面臨的民族主義浪潮只是其開端而已。其次，例如新冠疫情等外部世界會促使各國朝向更具堅韌性的國民經濟結構、降低全球化分工和依賴、以及嚴格邊境政策和貿易協定的方向發展。</p>

<p>透過以上兩個階段，科技巨頭的盈利空間將被大幅限縮，成長放緩，同時政府和監管者將能更有效對抗壟斷以及促進市場競爭。</p>

<p>鍍金時代終結的最後一步：改變市場激勵機制，尤其是改變股份酬勞、合併和收購、對期權課稅。</p>

<p>政府可以透過很多方式使科技巨頭無法繼續壟斷人力資本，鼓勵人才流向小型企業和新創公司，為產業生態注入活力。例如：以課稅的方式勸阻有一定規模的公司向員工發放 RSU、強制以 GAAP 原則呈報股份酬勞：修訂稅法讓小公司員工獲得的股份期權和薪水更划算。最後，政府必須阻止科技巨頭繼續實施人才收購 (acqui-hire)。</p>

<p>從本質來看，政府若能促使科技巨頭繼續開發成長的成本上升，同時新創公司的成長成本下降，我們將看到創業圈重現活力。</p>

<p>If these steps are undertaken, Big Tech will be crippled. If one reads the tea leaves, it seems like it is the time and many governments are sounding the drum to action. While Big Tech initially created a lot of value, the incremental value they deliver now comes at too high of a cost if these companies are left intact as they are. The value created is an increasingly decaying function (it’s difficult to name something truly innovative that Big Tech has invented in the last decade) while the need for true progress is increasing.</p>

<p>Climate change is worsening every day. Life expectancy in developed nations is plateauing or even falling and the education system is increasingly failing young people in preparing them adequately for the future. These gaps could have been filled by the massive R&amp;D budgets of Big Tech (cumulatively more than $600 Billion in the last decade) who promised to change the world and eradicate its evils, but it’s clear that it isn’t happening as they seem more focused on protecting their monopolies than advancing humanity.</p>

<p>If not waiting on Big Tech, we could also continue to wait for governments to step in and solve these issues. This is naive as the reality is that they can’t and they won’t. The gridlock in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere means that entrepreneurs are needed more than ever and that smart, ambitious ideas are society’s lifeblood.</p>

<h3 id="人才囤積">人才囤積</h3>
<p>Another overlooked outcome with the rise of Big Tech is that it has been conducting a massive intellectual sterilization and greenmailing of STEM grads. Again, imagine what these thousands of new grads could be doing in climate change, healthcare or education? Instead they ended up collecting massive RSU packages to work on irrelevant features for long-tail products that impact very few or stale, irrelevant features for products that are already at scale. I have tried to recruit too many smart people who are wasting their prime years of productivity working in Big Tech because ‘the pay is too good’.</p>

<p>We have a responsibility, as a society, to stop this talent hoarding. We went through a similar intellectual lobotomization leading into the Great Financial Crisis. At that time, talented STEM graduates were seduced by tantalizing pay packages to work at hedge funds. PhDs in physics were more likely to be working on options trading models than working on next generation clean energy or space exploration.</p>

<p>After the GFC, STEM grads fled Wall Street in droves but the lobotomization didn’t stop because Big Tech took over the starring role. Carbon sequestration? Resource scarcity? Materials Science? No thanks. Photo-tagging, short form video uploading and ad targeting were the work du jour.</p>

<h3 id="重啟太空競賽">重啟太空競賽</h3>
<p>A common theme amongst optimists is how much technological advance we have seen and how these advances seem to be accelerating. I am of the opposite camp and believe, roughly, that the rate of progress has been steadily declining since we landed on the moon in 1969. While I can’t explain the 1970s and 1980s, the modern Gilded Age’s lack of technological progress is easier to understand. The intellectual lobotomization of smart, young STEM talent has been an explicit strategy by Big Tech fueled by unseemly profitability and hi flying stock prices. If you can’t innovate but are wildly profitable, wouldn’t you also just pay the incremental talented engineer to work for you on anything versus working for a competitor or, worse still, work for themselves and invent something disruptive that could impact your monopoly? Of course you would…and they have.</p>

<p>If you were a bright, ambitious engineer graduating in STEM in the early 1960s this wasn’t the case. You went to work on something meaningful. The momentum towards spaceflight was a call to arms for the smartest and hardest working amongst us. These bright men and women worked to invent new capabilities and entire ecosystems in fuel cells, gas storage systems, thermodynamic materials, engines, mechanical timers and clocks and control systems to name a few. The cost of the entire Apollo program was $25 Billion or $150 Billion in today’s dollars.</p>

<p>Big Tech spent $75B on R&amp;D in 2018 alone. Put another way, this means that in two 2018 equivalents of R&amp;D spending, Big Tech could have sent people to the moon and back. It’s fair to say, however, that what we have witnessed instead can graciously be described as something less ambitious and impactful than that.</p>

<p>This misallocation of capital won’t end until we demand it - every government, regulator and individual now has a role to play whether you know it or not.</p>

<h3 id="關於市場">關於市場</h3>
<p>I am generally of the view that we have exhausted the ability for central banks to meaningfully manage inflation, in either direction, but that doesn’t mean it won’t continue to drive stock prices higher by unnecessarily cutting rates and flooding markets with money. Our simple framework is this: as money gets cheaper, the credit markets continue to expand because CEOs become motivated to artificially boost EPS. They do this by buying back stock, seek bad acquisitions, make poor capital allocation decisions or avoid taxes. All enabled by borrowing massive amounts of essentially free money. It shouldn’t surprise you to know that these decisions also result in ever increasing CEO pay.</p>

<p>And as rates continue to fall, investors are forced to re-evaluate risk premiums and look to own growth of any kind, even if that growth is in year 5+ of a business plan (a forecaster’s wet dream). The result is a seemingly ever higher stock market. For the programmers reading this, let me summarize this in pseudo-code:</p>

<p>For a company:</p>

<p>while interest_rates_tomorrow are less than or equal to interest_rates_today
  borrow cheap money
  buy back stock
  show wall street rising earnings_per_share
  get paid more
repeat
For an investor:</p>

<p>while interest_rates_tomorrow are less than or equal to interest_rates_today
  focus on years 5+ of any model if it shows growth however unbelievable
  buy the stock
  if the company is buying back stock
    buy more stock
repeat
As you can imagine, this has created a complex, interconnected credit-equity bubble. And like other bubbles before it, it will end badly. When it does, hopefully the human toll of these nested bad decisions aren’t too significant. In the case of Boeing, however, part of the hard landing has already been written and the consequences have been devastating with the loss of 346 innocent lives in two plane malfunctions. Digging deeper, it seems we can trace these tragic outcomes, in part, as the result of poor capital allocation and decision making by a CEO focused excessively on his compensation. Per the incoming CEO of the fired CEO:</p>

<p>“I’ll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis, whether it was a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up, or whether it was just beating the other guy to the next rate increase,” he said. He added later, “If anybody ran over the rainbow for the pot of gold on stock, it would have been him.”</p>

<p>I hope all CEOs reading this internalize how important it is to build a sustainable business and remember what Charlie Munger says about your incentives:</p>

<p>“Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.”</p>

<h3 id="關於績效">關於績效</h3>
<p>We had a fabulous year in 2019. It was our first full year operating as a holding company with no pressure from limited partners or the need to raise funds and manage the resulting incentives that come with partnerships. I’ve learned that investing isn’t a team sport. Company building is a team sport but capital allocation isn’t. It’s about a few good decisions, from time to time, supported by a lot of idiosyncratic thinking, reading and debate. I’m thankful to my team who helps me make these good decisions.</p>

<p>Our returns last year lifted our inception to date (“ITD”) performance by more than 350bp. We only report ITD performance because this is how our money compounds and allows us to not overly scrutinize any one year but focus on a repeatable pattern of long term thinking and behavior. Since inception in 2011 we have compounded our money 997%, beating the S&amp;P 500 (with dividends reinvested) by more than 3 times.</p>

<p>At the same time, in 2019, we generated more than $1.7 Billion in cash and cash equivalents. This focus on liquidity was an important goal. Liquidity will be increasingly important over the next few years; as you read this remember the moments of widening credit spreads, frozen repo markets and flash crashes. Selling, when appropriate, and generating cash in a thoughtful way seems to be a prudent decision for the next several years. The impact of externalities and exogenous events are no longer priced appropriately into the market - which seems to us as a signal to focus on it. Cash on hand will result in buying opportunities, even if they are short in duration, as the tide runs out from time to time and exposes the naked among us.</p>

<p>In 2019 we completed two transactions. The first was an investment of more than $500M into Virgin Galactic creating the first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company. We were given the opportunity to partner with Sir Richard Branson and his amazing team at Virgin and Virgin Galactic. A more charismatic, amiable and optimistic person I have yet to meet and it has been an honor working with him and his team thus far. The second company (which we are choosing to keep confidential for the time being) was an acquisition of a venture backed company that had raised almost $100M of traditional VC money. We bought this company because of our belief in their technology and market. I’m excited by both of these investments and think very highly of their long term prospects.</p>

<h3 id="現金-vs-期權">現金 vs 期權</h3>
<p>This second acquisition also allowed us to do something unconventional focused on employee compensation - we eliminated all options and paid people more. We asked what the salary surveys for each role in the company were and proceeded to pay everyone at the 100th percentile. Typically, startups pay at the 40-50th percentile and make up the difference with the potential future gain of options. Companies like Netflix, however, have shown that high cash compensation is oftentimes more valuable and helps retain their most experienced and high-performing talent. We have embarked on this path with this company and will replicate it wherever we can. We think paying people a high current income is what is most useful to most people. It allows them to live well, take care of their family, focus on working on what they love and allows the company to buck the trend of poor retention rates typical of most startups. For those employees that also want to own equity, we make it available each year for purchase. This is the truest form of ownership. Like in the stock market, you pay money for owning a piece of a company you want. Regardless, by paying a much higher living wage, we think we are making more content, happy and better retained employees. If we had a typical minority position in a startup, these changes wouldn’t have been possible because the venture capitalists would have surely blocked it.</p>

<h3 id="募得資本和創造價值的反相關性">募得資本和創造價值的反相關性</h3>
<p>Anti-correlation of money raised to value created
While some venture capitalists have proven to have great intuition and good capital allocation decision making, most of them are not up to the task of partnering with entrepreneurs to help usher ambitious new ideas to fruition. These ideas could be a compensation idea like the one above, or, even more importantly, the reason for the company to exist in the first place.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, the practitioners of venture capital continue to decay in capability and the historical experience they draw from - they’ve never done anything important! They are increasingly motivated by the incentives of up-rounds, bigger funds and fee-based compensation. The flood of fast money has created a surfeit of these overnight practitioners with questionable sources of capital and even more questionable backgrounds. The most telltale signs of this trend are in the decaying governance in high flying unicorns and the ravenous capital consumption of some of these companies.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<p>Big Tech raised a total of $1.345B in venture capital before going public of which $1.3B was Facebook alone. This means that Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google raised less than $45M combined before IPO. Even on an inflation adjusted basis, this is incredible and tells something very important about a raft of today’s startups.</p>

<p>They are not technology companies. They are tech-enabled hybrids. Tech companies don’t need to raise a lot of money. So to all employees out there: beware of the company that raises too much money and calls themselves a tech company. And when the founders are selling in these ever increasing rounds but you, as an employee, are not allowed…well…it says something dysfunctional about the governance, CEO, business model or all of the above.</p>

<p>While there is nothing wrong with being a tech-enabled hybrid, the returns, business model quality and valuation frameworks are different than those of tech companies. As we’ve seen with WeWork ($14B raised), Uber ($25B raised), Lyft ($5B) and a few other hi flying private companies, the public markets will rationalize valuation and enforce a valuation model that won’t allow tech-enabled hybrids to be valued like pure-play tech companies.</p>

<p>Expect more of these valuation resets as companies stay private longer (dumb), have poor or negative unit economics to drive growth (dumber) and continue to be over capitalized (dumb and dumber to).</p>

<p>Board members have a responsibility to help founders navigate these complexities but, except for a few VCs, the venture capital industry is letting down an entire generation of founders. A reminder to founders: VCs are incentivized to generate high salaries via ever larger funds and their attendant fees. Beware the VCs that raise funds every year - the best practitioners take their time and do not get distracted from the real prize - carried interest - which only comes when you and your employees are successful. As it turns out, grin-fucking you so they can write a big check and get closer to raising a new fund is easy to do but being a line in the sand that enables good decision making and helps you be patient while they, themselves, practice it too is much harder. Especially in today’s gold rush venture capital mindset. Pick your VC wisely.</p>

<p>A corollary to this is that as governance has decayed and the focus of most VCs is on uprounds and markups, there has been a meaningful decay in strategy at many startups.</p>

<p>Startups are increasingly building product features that depend more on a balance sheet of capital to differentiate themselves versus customer value that is unique and defensible. This creates feature wars that quickly become balance sheet wars when other startups or incumbents decide to copy these features. Free stock trading, hi-rate savings accounts, subsidized hardware tied to software, vacation rentals and ride sharing are some current examples.</p>

<p>While any one feature can quickly drive customer adoption, if capital allows others to compete - they invariably will. The problem with this kind of decision making is that your original customer has now come for a free toke of a cigarette butt - for a feature that has costs, but is subsidized by your last fundraising round. If you then expect that same user to stay for a paid, three course meal, you may be disappointed. Said differently, if you encourage your users to act like hobos, they will, and your only solution is to keep raising capital which isn’t always possible.</p>

<h3 id="與我們合作">與我們合作</h3>
<p>Many of the opinions raised thus far are complicated and potentially off-putting. That said, our track record has reaffirmed our need to be, if nothing else, candid and honest. In that spirit, we would be remiss without speaking directly to entrepreneurs and employees reading this: if you are working on something hard and useful, we want to meet you. Maybe we end up partnering with you so you can work on these ideas in a supportive but challenging environment where capital is plentiful, compensation is great and a compelling need to change the world is the priority.</p>

<h3 id="使命感與寬恕">使命感與寬恕</h3>
<p>As we enter the final years of the Gilded Age and usher in the Progressive Era, a more civilized culture will hopefully abound. Today, it’s not just the stock market but also the fragmentation, polarization and judgement that are at all time highs.</p>

<p>Is this really the hallmark of a society that is progressive? No. It’s the remnants of unhappiness, resentment and anger that personify the Gilded Age. That said, it’s so much easier to be happy and see the bigger picture when you focus on what matters. So how does one focus on what matters? I’ve found it possible by asking questions like “what matters to me?” and “what is important to me?” These may sound like the most basic questions but they are also the most critical. And especially now, these are the questions that need lucid, non-judgemental answers from each of us.</p>

<p>For me, I have learned that my family, my health and what I know (knowledge) are the most important things that matter to me. Work, money and friendships are important but come strictly after the first three. What doesn’t matter? Everything else, particularly, what others think about me and my decisions.</p>

<p>These truths about myself help me make defensible decisions and focus on the long-term impact I choose to have. To get to these truths about myself, I spoke to many dozens of people to learn what is important to them, why, and how they got to those realizations. These people have represented all levels of success and failure and beyond what I learned from them explicitly, my implicit learnings on this journey have been even more important which I offer here:</p>

<p>Be emotionally rich and available. It’s worthwhile and teaches you to have the patience to be compassionate versus harsh. Then observe what happens when you follow this advice.
Be coherent and honest with other people. It makes life much fairer for both yourself and the person in front of you. When you practice honesty with compassion, amazing relationships will be born.
Take the advice of others but carefully consider how it applies to you. What works for others may not work for you.
Secrets hidden in plain sight
Along the way, I’ve also become more observant of simple truths that are presented to us every day. In the crush of day to day life, these secrets are hidden, but when your mind slows down enough to take them in, their simplicity and elegance are worth internalizing. I offer one of them here:</p>

<p>“Put on your oxygen mask before helping others”</p>

<p>We’ve been told this innumerable times on airplanes and see it written in the safety cards in the seat pocket in front of us. But what it says is something beyond the obvious which is that you cannot help others until you help yourself. When you are at your best, you can give your best in any situation and to those around you. Keep that in mind as you build for the long run.</p>
