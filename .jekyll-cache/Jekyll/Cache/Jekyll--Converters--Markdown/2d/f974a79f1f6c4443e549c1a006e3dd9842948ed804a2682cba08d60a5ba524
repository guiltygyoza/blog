<p>This report by People Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English.</p>

<h3 id="question-2-how-to-solve-for-accurate-timely-and-sufficient-gdp-statistics">Question 2: How to solve for accurate, timely, and sufficient GDP statistics?</h3>

<p><strong>My proposal is: explore marketized big data, analyze the process of GDP statistics formation at the micro scale, and construct a new univariate econometric model based on individual value function.</strong></p>

<p>The modern time calls for a new macroeconomic data industry, where modern information technology is fully leveraged to build a macroeconomic big data system that is real-time, dynamic, and accurate, and to transform this process into a process of value creation. The fourth plenary meeting of the nineteenth Central Committee of the CPC made it very clear that data is a mean of production and is involved in economic resource allocation in China. Large-scale macroeconomic models will be built on this foundation, solve for accurate and timely economic big data and achieve objectivity and timeliness in our monetary policy-making.</p>

<h4 id="multivariate-big-data-model-for-gdp">Multivariate big data model for GDP</h4>
<p>First, we shall construct the multivariate big data for GDP by considering the four sectors: families (f), businesses (b), governments (g) and exports (e). The GDP equals to the sum of value functions of all sectors:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/CodeCogsEqn.svg" alt="equation" /></p>

<p>Given that, we can solve for both output-based and income-based GDP. From the income perspective, we shall consider:</p>
<ol>
  <li>labor income</li>
  <li>business revenue</li>
  <li>tax revenue</li>
  <li>export revenue</li>
</ol>

<p>From the output perspective, we shall consider:</p>
<ol>
  <li>consumption</li>
  <li>investment</li>
  <li>government spending</li>
  <li>oversea spending</li>
</ol>

<p>For output-based</p>
