<p>This report by People Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English.</p>

Bank of China</p>

<h4 id="question-1-is-the-gdp-number-reported-by-the-national-bureau-of-statistics-of-china-nbs-accurate">Question 1: Is the GDP number reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) accurate?</h4>

<p>This question touches the heart of macroeconomy policy making. According to research, the statistics reported by the NBS does not reflect the true GDP, wherein the error is considerably large. Due to country-to-country differences in their conditions, as well as the different bandwidth and coverage in statistics gathering, there is no value in comparing GDPs across different countries. The dogmatic application of traditional monetary policy model will result in clear monetary policy failure. Therefore, the statistics from the NBS shall not serve as the only data that drives policy making; we need to build big data model for GDP and implement marketization, fine-grain and dynamic data management.</p>

<p>Due to its important role in policy making, the measurement of GDP shall tolerate no compromise at all. In 2015, IMF predicted that we have approached the end of the American Era — China’s GDP based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) will surpass the US in 5 years — and that 2016 will be the first year of the Chinese Era. This statement was an atomic bomb to the western countries and fueled controversy. The western media voiced their doubt and anxiety. In reality, this conclusion was complete bullshit. The reason is that the PPP was derived from the chosen basket of goods, but the estimates of their true prices were erroneous. Currently the price of major agricultural produce and the price of durable consumer goods based on PPP in China are higher than the western countries. IMF’s conclusion is therefore invalid.</p>

<p>(<em>From my own research experience, I opined that IMF’s conclusion and methodology is inapplicable to China’s situation. I attended the training program designed for central bank senior managers and discovered that many of their research methodologies are completely inapplicable to China. For instance, IMF uses the Life-Cycle Hypothesis (LCH) extensively to analyze investments and savings, but they fail to recognize the unique tradition and economic structure of each country. Families are the basic building blocks of China’s economy, while the LCH assumes that individuals are the basic building blocks of an economy as is the case in the US among other developed countries. The life cycle curves of these two ___ are very different. China’s curve would like an upward linear trend, while the LCH’s one would look like a normal distribution. An obvious evidence is that savings rates in China and Southeast Asian countries are higher than that of western countries.</em>)</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin, we should acknowledge that China’s GDP has been grossly underestimated, which is an important aspect of the Chinese characteristics. That there is massive leakage in GDP statistics measurement should be recognized, otherwise government failure will become the norm, and decisions will always be made from grossly incomplete information.</p>

<p>(<em>China’s GDP has always been difficult to measure, primarily because of the particularity of China’s economy. China’s reported M2/GDP exceeds 200%, which obviously contradicts with the financial depth of China. M2, the nominator, is perhaps significantly overestimated due to problems in China’s financial system — a system originated from a planned economy, where the financial market and currency market are underdeveloped such that direct finance dominates the scene of China’s financial system, causing a concentration of capital in the banking system, sometimes sitting idle even. And GDP, the denominator, is underestimated for many reasons. In recent years, the degree of GDP underestimation is reduced by the disappearance of many gray economies, which must have contributed to the decline in economic momentum. The deterioration of microeconomic environments leave millions of these small businesses to their own devices. This is perhaps the biggest loss invisible to China’s economy. They are the earth on which China’s economy develops.</em>)</p>

<p>Logically and empirically speaking, there are five angles to approach the problem of the underestimation of China’s GDP:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The structure of China’s economy is very complicated. The building blocks are the families, and there are an abundance of centrally-owned and state-owned enterprise. There are a myriad of internal transactions — a son working for his father without earning an income, income earned from the private plots allocated to an individual on a collective farm is not included in the calculation of GDP, and capital movements between centrally-owned and state-owned enterprises are counted as internal transactions as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree of China’s marketization is far too low that a massive amount of products and services are not recorded into the transaction process because of obscure property rights and therefore are not treated as commodity.</p>
