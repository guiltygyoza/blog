Always strive to resist the temptation of adopting the many playbooks that are pathological in our industry out of convenience, especially when done in the name of “practicality”.

It's a slippery road. Along its path, the seeker loses sight of why they set out on this venture to begin with.

"Practicality" is such a strong position, such difficult to argue against. It seemingly stands as pure merit.

But it forecloses the possibilities of first-principle thinking and creative problem-solving.

Strive to be part of the solution, not the problem -- a choice to be made anew every day.
