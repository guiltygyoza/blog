Special thanks to Maurice Lee and Austin Liu for inspirations.

ELI-5: transparent/obfuscated; patent application via a legal entity bonded to a derived DAO member set from DIP ledger; data structure for DP ledger matching verifier ledger.

ELI-15:
1- Following the motivations laid out in [Decentralizing patent offices](){:target="_blank"}, I sketch out a few considerations that will be crucial for designing sustainable decentralized innovation protocols (DIPs).

2- use combustion CFD (computational fluid dynamics) as example; raptor engine simulation
