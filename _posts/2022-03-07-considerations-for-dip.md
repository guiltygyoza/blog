Special thanks to Maurice Lee and Austin Liu for inspirations.

ELI-15:
1- Following the motivations laid out in [Decentralizing patent offices](){:target="_blank"}, I sketch out a few considerations that will be crucial for designing sustainable decentralized innovation protocols (DIPs).

2- Q: do we use combustion engine as example (I am less familiar with; need to research on its components and the simulators involved; yet it seems more exciting as it's used in Raptor engine at SpaceX), or do we use RTL design for arithmetics, such as adder composing multipliers composing PEs (I am more familiar with;yet this seems unrelated to physics, where my current intuition lies)
