This is a two-part blogpost presenting a friendly digest of the [PRIBLT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02668){:target="_blank"} and some unsolicited life advice. Part 1 sets up the problem of set reconciliation and explores prior art. Part 2 plunges into PRIBLT.

## Problem formulation

Denote Alice's set of things as $$A$$, and Bob's $$B$$. Refer to the items in their sets as *source symbols*. Denote the symmetric difference between their sets as $$A \triangle B$$. Neither Alice nor Bob knows anything about the other's set. They wish to learn $$A \triangle B$$ by communicating over a reliable channel.

Design a coding scheme, comprising an encoding procedure $$\mathbb{C}$$ and a corresponding decoding procedure $$\mathbb{C}^{-1}$$, for the following usage:

1. Alice uses $$\mathbb{C}$$ to transform $$A$$ into an infinite stream of *coded symbols* $$\mathbb{C}(A) = \{a_0, a_1, a_2, ...\}$$, which Alice streams to Bob over a reliable communication channel.

2. Bob also uses $$\mathbb{C}$$ to transform $$B$$ into coded symbols $$\mathbb{C}(B) = \{b_0, b_1, b_2, ...\}$$.

3. Bob, upon starting to receive Alice's coded symbols, "subtract" (XOR) them pair-wise from his own coded symbols to produce the coded *diffs* $$\{a_0 \oplus b_0, a_1 \oplus b_1, a_2 \oplus b_2, ...\}$$.

4. Every time Bob yields a new coded diff, Bob attempts to decode (inverse transform) them using $$\mathbb{C}^{-1}$$. If decoding succeeds, Bob tells Alice to stop sending her coded symbols.

The coding scheme must meet the following requirements:

1. $$\mathbb{C}(A) \oplus \mathbb{C}(B) = \mathbb{C}(A \triangle B)$$. Equivalently, $$A \triangle B = \mathbb{C}^{-1}(\mathbb{C}(A) \oplus \mathbb{C}(B))$$. This means by decoding the coded diffs, Bob obtains the coveted set difference.

2. Denote the size of the set difference as $$d$$, namely $$d = \vert A \triangle B \vert$$. With high probability, Bob can successfully decode $$\mathbb{C}(A) \oplus \mathbb{C}(B)$$ when he receives $$\eta * d$$ amount of coded symbols from Alice, where $$\eta > 1$$ is a small *overhead*. For example, say Alice and Bob each has 1 million things in their set, and their sets only differ by 150 things. The amount of coded symbols Bob needs from Alice to decode should be around 200 to 500, a small multiple of 150.

## From mapping to yielding

IBLT maps a set of source symbols to a predetermined finite amount of coded symbols. However, PRIBLT transforms a set of source symbols to an *infinite* amount of coded sybmols. ...
