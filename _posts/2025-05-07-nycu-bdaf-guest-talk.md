With the kind invitation of Martinet at Quantstamp/Zircuit, I gave a guest lecture at [NYCU](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index){:target="_blank"} in Taiwan for the [Blockchain Development and FinTech course](https://github.com/bdaf-course/bdaf-coursepage){:target="_blank"}. I took the liberty to define the nature my talk, one that situates the advent of decentralized consensus networks in a bigger picture. I challenged myself to trace things back 100 years, back to when Hitler became the leader of the reestablished Nazi party. Why?

"*Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks*" was engraved into the genesis block of Bitcoin. This industry was born from the invention of a global digital ledger that explicitly wishes to disassociates itself from the governments of the world. Why? On the streets, one would have no trouble finding a large number of answers - the issue with the dollar's worth, US debts and so on. Case in point, just over the last few days the industry's timeline is filled with comments about the [downgrade of US credit rating](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/u-s-loses-last-triple-a-credit-rating-bfcbae5d){:target="_blank"} and the rising of bond yields.

Yet, this industry cares enormously about what the regulators think. News about ETF approvals stroke the nerves of market participants. A system that was created to operate fiercely independently in spite of governments are valued by investors closely watching the sentiment of governments toward said system. That is a fascinating paradox.

All in all, I wish to dig into the history about the tanglement of money, US fiscal policy, and geopolitics. Gain my own perspective. And share my learning with the students.

History fascinates. One can depth-first-search endlessly in the literatures. History also dwarfs. There are so much interdependent factors at work that I am afraid any of my attempts to connect some dots in support of specific arguments are doomed to be premature.

But I reconsidered. A while ago I stumbled upon [*Bird by Bird*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird){:target="_blank"} by Anne Lamott, a book about how to write:

> *We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said "Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird."*

I decided that it's ok to take the history bird by bird. It's ok to share my embeddings while I am still rummaging through my input data. It's ok to override past expressions in light of new insights.

The following captures the talk in text form.

Thank you Martinet for the graceful introduction. Originally I wanted to give you guys some ideas about decentralized systems and consensus. But, I thought that we are in a very interesting time, and blockchain is not just a technology for the sake of technology, it actually has lots of implications in the big big picture. So I thought it would be very useful to tell you what I see at the big picture level, what does that mean to blockchains and beyond.

## Debt & Currency

So I wanted to start with the idea of debt and currency which are extremely old ideas dating back to at least 5000 years ago.

<br/>

But let's just go back by 100 years. In 1925, Hitler came out of prison. He went to prison because he attempted a coup at the Weimar government and failed. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison but was very quickly bailed out. In 1925 he came the Nazi party leader. Mein Kempf is the book he wrote in the prison, where he talked about his struggle and his political ideology, which is a widely read book and banned because it obviously contributed to the massacre of Jews.

<br/>

Going to 1929. What happened in 1929 was a bunch of things. But we have to cover the Dawes Plan. Basically Germany came out of the WWI, losing the war, owing a lot of money to allie countries. So Germany had to pay for the reparations for other European countries. That put a lot of pressure on the German economy. Therefore a plan was in place for the US to loan money to Germany to pay for the reparations. Because of this loan, the economic pressure was relieved and that actually caused a golden period, the *Goldene Zwanziger*, where the economy was booming. That was when the hyperinflation just receded around 1923. But what happened in 1929 was that the Wall Street crashed. If you're American and your economy is not doing so well, the first thing you would cut is paying the country that just lost the war. So the US cut down their loans to Germany and asked for repayments sooner, causing the German economy to deteriorate very quickly So that was the historical context where the Nazi rose.

If you look at this election results of the Nazy party at the German parliamentary. In 1928, the Nazi party got 2.6% of the parliament. Already in 1932, just four years later, it's got 37% of the parliamentary. It was a very fast rise.

<br/>
<img src="/assets/2025-05-07/debt-4.jpg" />

That ultimately resulted in 1993 where Hitler was appointed the chancellor of Germany by the president, Hindenburg, who was a very old man (85 years old). Before Hitler became Chancelor, there were two more Chancelors that were trying to keep Hitler out of the office, but the German economy was doing so badly, they couldn't really change it. And in a democracy, you are supposed to make decisions based on the people's will, and with Nazi party's rise in the parliamentary, that basically meant the Nazi represented the people's voice. Due to the rule of democracy, it was almost inevitable that the Nazi party leader became the Chancelor. Article 48  of the Weimar Constitution basically meant that before Hitler became the Chancelor, the parliamentary was blocking so many laws from passing, obviously Nazi being very much at odds with other parties. They couldn't reach consensus and the parliamentary broke down all the time. If you have a parliamentary breakdown, no laws can be passed, the government basically stops operating. So Article 48 was the idea that in extraordinary time, the president can sign special laws that go into effect immediately, bypassing the congress. But that means the democracy was failing, which further incited people's anger, espeically the people that were under Hitler's influence.

One thing that is tragically interesting to note is that in 1925 Hitler was ordered by the court to not give public speech for two years. Because Hitler was great at public speeches and so great at making people angry and follow what he said. His public speech was dangerous. The court ordered he could not give public speeches. In fact, he attempted the coup, and treason warrants the death sentence. But he actually gave public speeches at the court which changed the opinions and he go sentenced to 5 years and came out in mere 9 months. So that was a demonstration of his ability to influence and trigger the madness of the crowd, a central topic of the WWII.

WWII happened. Fast forward to 1944. Germany was losing. At the time of the Normandy Landing, on June 6, 1944, another very famous conference that was quietly happening but determining the world order after the war was the Bretton Woods Conference, between June 1st and 22nd, 1944. It happened in this very old and shabby hotel where the leaders of many countries came to talk about "so what are we going to do with our money after the war?" Because, in a sense, Germans started the war because there was tremendous monetary problems and the order of money. In order to prevent another war from happening - 50 million people died from WWII - let's find a much better world order for international monetary system.

What's interesting is in 1940, Nazi was imagining that they would win the war and they were already imagining how they would design the international monetary order. They came up with this idea of a gold backed system, which ultimately became the gold-backed system decided at the Bretton Woods Conference.

What's also interesting is before the gold-backed system was decided, another system was considered. What's problematic about currencies is that you have a country that is importing a lot but exporting a little, or vice versa, you have problems where the currencies are either unfair to country A or country B. So the best idea is for countries to import and export the same amounts of different goods and commodities. So the first proposal at the conference was - let's design a system that incentivizes countries to balance their trades. If you have unbalanced trades, you would be punished by the system. But it was obviously rejected because the US had massive trade imbalance and they thought "*we won the war, so we want the system to work in favor for us, not against us. We don't want a international monetary order that is punishing us right out of the war.*"

<br/>

So eventually we came to this Bretton Woods system. The idea is that gold is rare and everyone wants gold. Gold is cleraly the desire of all human beings. Let's use gold as the ultimate value denominator. Let's fixed US dollars to one ounce of gold exchanged for 35 US dollars as a constant. And let's negotiate fixed exchanged rates between US dollar and each of the currencies of other nations. So all the rates were determiined at the conference, obviously a lot of politics were involved, based on who contributed and who had stronger voices. But this was the order coming out of WWII.
