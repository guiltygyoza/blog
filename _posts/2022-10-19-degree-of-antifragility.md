Summary: Let's be more antifragile to innovate faster.

1- As Topology pushes the frontier and explores the unknowns, *stressors* and *how we adapt to stressors* seems to strictly determines how fast we learn and grow. Taleb's teaching feels visceral to us.

2- Letâ€™s coin a term: Degree of Antifragility (DOA). Increasing DOA allows for faster growth. Decreasing DOA leads to longer stasis, staying stuck, being less attentive to lessons and adaptive to feedback, and at worst pressures one to deceive externally and internally, which all lead to slower growth or slow death.

3- One factor that lowers DOA is system dependency. If iterating on A requires changing B, the iteration speed for A is lower than otherwise.

4- Yet another factor that lowers DOA is the pressure to fulfill premature public promises (PPP). Depending on the nature of projects or products, failure to meet PPPs may lead to brand losing trust. The misled desire to not disappoint could lead one organization to making even more PPPs to appease the public - "we won't deliver X on D day because we decided to take on X^2, a grander project, to be delivered on D+D day", making it a bigger mess to deal with eventually.

5- Yet another factor that lowers DOA is sunk cost fallacy. The key here is to identify whether a cost is sunk cost that should be severed, or opportunity cost that should be dealt with persistence. Failure to recognize sunk cost fallacy could lead to making PPPs which further lowers DOA and entrenches the organization in the wrong direction; worse, it could lead to internal delusion. If internal delusion is persisted by the leadership at power positions, it could shut down honest voices in the organization, sever its neural system and kill it slowly as resource and morale runs out.

6- Let's reduce or avoid PPPs. Let's be mindful of and overcome sunk cost fallacy. Let's strive to iterate on smaller components in modular systems. Let's increase our DOA to innovate faster.
